# Projectone.playground
This is my very first iOS project completed 3 years ago. This code is very ugly, for this is my very first dip in iOS, so have fun roasting my ugly ass code. 
This is apart of my portfolio to show where I started to compared to where I am now. For this project I created A soccer cordinator app that divides 18 players into 
three well-balanced teams. It also sends emails out to each parents reminding them the practice times.
